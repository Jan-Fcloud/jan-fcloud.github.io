# jans.dev
This repo, is for my dev oriented website.

The current version that is published, is under a different branch called "gh-pages", and not main.
Main is the newest version I am developing. So if you need the HTML for the current live website, it's there and not here.

## Current GH-PAGES version
The current live version of the site doesn't have much. It acts similar to a carrd or beacons site.
I am currently working on redoing my entire site again with a different focus.

## Next GH-PAGES version (WIP)
My next website, will have a fun twist on operating systems. More specifically Windows 98. I am planning on adding a lot of things to it and not just make it look like the OS and wrap up.
