# jans.dev
This repo, is for my dev oriented website.

The current version that is published, is under a different branch called "gh-pages", and not main.
Main is the newest version I am developing. So if you need the HTML for the current live website, it's there and not here.

## Current GH-PAGES version
The current live version of the site doesn't have much. It acts similar to a carrd or beacons site.
I am currently working on redoing my entire site again with a different focus.

## New website
I'm working on a new website built with Angular.
